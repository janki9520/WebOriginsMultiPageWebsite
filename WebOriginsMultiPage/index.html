              <p>The <strong>Internet</strong> is the global system of interconnected computer networks that use TCP/IP protocol suite to link billions of devices worldwide. </p>
              <p>It was conceived by the <strong>Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA)</strong> of the U.S. government in <strong>1969</strong> and was first known as the <strong>ARPANet.</strong> </p>
              <p> Internet is used as a <strong> “BACKBONE” </strong> for other online applications, including Email, Instant Messaging, Skype, Streaming Video, and the World Wide Web.</p>

              <h2>Internet vs WWW</h2>  
              <p>Web & Internet are two seperate but related things <strong>(Web!=Internet)</strong>.</p>
              <p>The <strong>Internet </strong> is a massive network of networks, a networking infrastructure. It connects millions of computers together globally, forming a network in which any computer can communicate with any other computer as long as they are both connected to the Internet.</p>
              <p>Whereas, the <strong>World Wide Web</strong>, or simply Web, is a way of accessing information over the medium of the Internet. It is <strong>an information-sharing model</strong> that is built on top of the Internet. The Web uses the <strong>HTTP protocol</strong>, only one of the languages spoken over the Internet, to transmit data. Web services, which use HTTP to allow applications to communicate in order to exchange business logic, use the the Web to share information. </p>

                  <p> <strong>World Wide Web(www)</strong> is a system of interlinked hypertext documents connected by the internet.</p>
                  <p><strong>Tim Berners-Lee</strong>, a British scientist at <strong>CERN</strong>, invented the World Wide Web (WWW) in <strong>1989</strong>.</p>
                  <p>The <strong>web</strong> was originally conceived and developed to meet the demand for <strong> automatic information-sharing </strong>between scientists in universities and institutes around the world.</p>
                  <p><strong>Tim</strong> suggested three main technologies that meant all computers could understand each other <strong>(HTML, URL and HTTP).</strong> All of these remain in use today.</p>
