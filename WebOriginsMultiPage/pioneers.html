                <p>During World War II, Vannevar Bush Vannevar Bushfacilitated a relationship between the federal government, the American scientific community, and business.</p>
                <p> After the war, he helped institutionalize that relationship. As a result, organizations like the National Science Foundation and Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA), were created. It was at ARPA that the Internet first began.</p>
                <p> Bush also wrote a paper entitled, "As We May Think," in 1945.</p>
                <p> In this paper he described a theoretical storage and retrieval device, called a "Memex," which would use a system remarkably similar to what we now call hypertext. </p>
